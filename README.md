# Easzy's stock managment
  Simple stock management application. This is a training, I doubt that this application is really usable.

# Test the app
You have to create a local database (I use WAMP). Username: root and no password. Import the SQL database located in "stock-managment-app/Database/". Clone the repository and execute the .exe file located in "stock-managment-app/Release/StockManagmentApp.exe".
